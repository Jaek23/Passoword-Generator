# Password Generator
Random password generator 
## Description
This project was focused on applying JavaScript fundamentals through the use of creating variables with certain data types, functions with conditional statements as well as other JavaScript properties and methods. 
## Usage 
When you open the password generator, there will be a text box in the center with a "Generate Password" button. If you click on the "Generate Password" button, a series of questions will pop up asking you about the password's requirements. Once you answer the series of pop-up questions, it will generate a random password with your selected password requirements and be displayed inside the text box.
